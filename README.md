# hello-world

Just the standard hello-world repository 

Justin-James here, I'm new to the whole world of programming and github. As of right now I am a Research Specialist at the University of Missouri-Columbia. I've decided that I no longer want to pursue biological research as a career. I'm very interested in the world of programming and thought I would give it a shot. Maybe even make a career change! Life is too short to be unhappy!
